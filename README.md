# 8005-agv-protocol

Shared executable protocol contracts for the 8005 AGV full product
(`AGV_FULL_PRODUCT`).

## Current state

The repository currently contains an **unapproved `2.0.0` superseding content
snapshot** for `ProtocolVersion = 3` and profile `AGV_FULL_PRODUCT`.
`protocol-v1.0.0` remains immutable, and `protocol-v2.0.0` does not exist yet.

This candidate is **breaking** against `protocol-v1.0.0`
(`BREAKING_PROTOCOL_VERSION_INCREASE`, `INCOMPATIBLE_EXACT_IDENTITY_REQUIRED`):
seven changes, each of them a `required`, `type` or meaning change — the station
departure deadline and `OPERATOR_TIMEOUT`, dispatch-scoped sublot entry, an
empty `slotResults` on a cancellation authorized before loading, sublot
rejection reason codes, the restored charging fields, the loading phase, and a
`slotOperationAttemptId` on the three recovery messages. See
[`compatibility/report.json`](compatibility/report.json) for the full list.

It is not a formal `ProtocolRelease` until a release approval (the product
owner, or an AI agent the product owner authorized) covers its exact commit,
manifest, vectors hash and compatibility classification. Both sides consume it
as a candidate: `ApprovalStatus = SUPERSEDING_CANDIDATE`, and gate evidence
produced on it is `UNRELEASED_CANDIDATE` and does not count towards a batch
exit.

Machine-readable JSON Schema, the message manifest, error registry, valid and
invalid examples, deterministic trajectories, runner/result contracts, and the
integration-slice index are authoritative. Markdown is explanatory only.

G1 PASS proves candidate-internal consistency only. It does not prove G0 human
approval, either product implementation, G2/G3, real RIoT, real IO, target
hardware, or factory qualification.
